# django-projects

Q: What is this repo?

A: This repo serves as a proving ground of sorts for my Django side projects and all live on the same [server](https://projects.djpeacher.com/)!

Q: Why are they all in the same repo/server?

A: I have tons of ideas, but there is just too much [static friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Static_friction) involved with spinning up a new project (not to mention the cost).
